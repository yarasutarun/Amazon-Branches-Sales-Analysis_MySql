This project analyzes Amazon sales data using SQL and Power BI. It focuses on identifying sales trends, top-performing products, and branch comparisons. SQL was used for data processing, and Power BI created interactive dashboards for insights. The goal is to drive data-driven decisions on sales performance of three different branches.

# Amazon Sales Analysis: 
This project analyzes Amazon sales data from various branches using SQL queries. The goal is to extract key insights and trends related to sales performance, customer behavior, product lines, and revenue generation. The analysis provides valuable information that can support data-driven business decisions.

# Project Overview: 
This project is designed to explore Amazon sales data, identify performance metrics, and generate insights regarding:  
Sales performance across branches and product lines. Customer types and their purchasing behavior. Trends in payment methods, VAT contributions, and ratings. The most profitable cities, product lines, and customer demographics.  

# Key Features: 
**Sales Insights:** Identifying which product lines, branches, and cities generate the most revenue.   
**Customer Analysis:** Analyzing the purchasing patterns of different customer types and their ratings.   
**Payment & VAT Insights:** Understanding the most frequently used payment methods and identifying which product lines and cities contribute the most VAT.   
**Time & Day Analysis:** Exploring the times of day and days of the week with the highest customer ratings and purchases.  

# Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to uncover trends and patterns from the sales data, providing actionable insights that can help improve sales strategies, inventory management, and customer targeting for Amazon branches.

# Tools Used: 
## SQL: 
For querying and analyzing the sales data stored in the database. Power BI (Optional): For visualizing and presenting the insights and trends.  

# Insights and Analysis: 
**Sales Trends:** The dataset is analyzed to determine which months and product lines perform the best in terms of total sales and revenue generation.   
**Customer Behavior:** Insights are drawn from customer data to identify the most frequent customer types, gender distribution, and times of day when purchases are highest.   
**Revenue Generation:** The analysis identifies which product lines, cities, and branches contribute the highest revenue, as well as the payment methods with the most transactions.   
**VAT Analysis:** The contribution of Value Added Tax (VAT) across different product lines and cities is also analyzed to understand the tax impact on sales.  

**Key Questions Addressed:** 
What are the best-performing product lines and branches?   
How do customer types and genders influence purchasing behavior?   
What are the most frequent payment methods used by customers?   
Which cities and branches generate the highest revenue and VAT contributions?   
When do customers provide the highest ratings, and what factors influence these ratings?  

**How to Use:** 
Clone this repository to your local machine.
